  # Install required packages
  ## Required because module is not an R package
  install.packages(

    repos = unique(c("predictiveecology.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos"))))


## RUN TESTS ----

  # Run all tests
  testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat")

  # Run all tests with different reporters
  testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat", reporter = testthat::LocationReporter)
  testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat", reporter = testthat::SummaryReporter)
